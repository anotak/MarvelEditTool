some MVC3 tools by anotak, dantarion, ferdinand and voltaic

anmchr is a more complex file because it controls the script of every action, you can piece them together however you like and it allows just about as much freedom as the game will allow.
it can be daunting to learn, just take some baby steps, cobble some stuff together

if you shift+drag/click or ctrl+drag/click you can select multiple times, then shift+right click to offset multiple times, be sure to increase your total time before you do this
anmchr will not let you go past your current limit on your total time, and if you disagree to hit the max values you wont be able to use this offset until you restart
